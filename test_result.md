    message: "🧖 DISCOUNT SYSTEM TESTING COMPLETE (Serbian Review Request): 5/6 tests PASSED, 1 CRITICAL ISSUE found. ✅ PASSED: 1) CORS with https://spa-system-fixes.preview.emergentagent.com, 2) GET /api/services pricing fields (final_price, discount_percentage), 3) GET /api/spa/services pricing fields (original_price, discount_percent, final_price, has_discount), 4) PATCH /api/services/{id}/discount with allowed values 0,5,10,15%, 5) PATCH /api/spa/services/{id}/discount with 15% test. ❌ CRITICAL: Double discount calculation in GET /api/services list endpoint - PATCH returns final_price: 3740 (correct), but services list shows 3179 (double discounted). Backend lines 701-771 in get_services() function needs fixing."

    message: "❌ END-TO-END PUBLIC SPA BOOKING TEST RESULTS (RETRY): MIXED PROGRESS WITH CRITICAL ISSUES REMAINING. ✅ PRICING DISPLAY IMPROVEMENT: Silky Body Ritual card now correctly displays '150 min 9.400 RSD 7.990 RSD' showing proper 15% discount calculation (9.400 → 7.990 RSD). This is a significant improvement from previous test. ❌ BOOKING FORM INTERACTION FAILURE: 1) Zakažite button is visible but not clickable due to viewport/overlay issues - multiple click attempts failed with 'element is outside of the viewport' errors. 2) Form submission process remains broken - unable to complete booking flow. 3) Admin panel verification confirms no new bookings created ('Nema rezervacija za izabrani period'). ✅ ADMIN PANEL FUNCTIONALITY: Successfully logged in with password 'studio149' and accessed reservation listings, confirming admin system is working correctly. CONCLUSION: While pricing display has been fixed, the core booking functionality (button interaction and form submission) still requires immediate attention to enable successful public bookings."
